# Combine_Cycle_Power_Plant
Key Components and Workflow:

Data Collection: The model requires historical operational data from the combined cycle power plant, including variables such as ambient temperature, exhaust pressure, steam pressure, and turbine inlet temperature. These data points serve as the foundation for optimizing the plant's efficiency.

Feature Scaling: Before applying Gradient Descent, the input features are scaled to ensure that they are on the same scale. This prevents features with larger magnitudes from disproportionately influencing the optimization process.

Objective Function: The model defines an objective function that quantifies the plant's efficiency. This function calculates a performance metric, such as thermal efficiency, which represents the ratio of useful energy output to the total energy input.

Gradient Descent: Gradient Descent is a powerful optimization technique that iteratively updates the operational parameters to minimize the objective function. The gradient (derivative) of the objective function with respect to each parameter guides the direction and magnitude of the parameter updates.

Learning Rate: The learning rate determines the step size taken in the direction of the negative gradient. It's a crucial hyperparameter that influences the convergence speed and stability of the optimization process.
